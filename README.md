# hgf_control
Final group project for the translational neuromodeling course at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
We conceptualized and made a framework that uses Hierarchical Gaussian Filters (HGF)
for control of a single variable in an environment. The GUI allows for easy
visualization and comparison between an Allostatic control framework's control and
that of the HGF. Different features can be altered like the noise that the model
'thinks' exists and the noise that actually is in the environment.
